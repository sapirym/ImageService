This exercise was built in a mobile application which will activate a service that will listen to the BroadcastReceiver which belongs to the WIFI connection.

Each time the phone is connected to a WIFI connection, a TCP communication channel will be opened and all images stored on the phone (which were taken by the camera) will be transferred.

When the app starts transferring the images it will display
ProgressBar which will show the progress of sending images

*The software is written using Studio Android
